        <p>Vi har i dag den 1. desember, der det 5. partiet skal spilles. Dette kan du se på NRK2 fra kl. 13:15.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>A minimal, modern CSS reset</li>
        <li>A responsive, mobile-first grid built on flexbox</li>
        <li>A well-designed, fluid typographic scale</li>
        <li>CSS buttons</li>
        <li>Simple table styling</li>
        <li>Common form components</li>
        <li>A set of utility classes for nudging and tweaking the layout</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Kraken isn&#39;t supposed to be a finished product. It&#39;s a starting point that you can adapt to any project you&#39;re working on. Add components. Remove components. Tweak the colors and font stack. Make Kraken your own.</p>
        <h2 id="the-kraken-approach">The Kraken Approach</h2>
        <p>Kraken is built to be flexible and modular, with performance and accessibility in mind.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Ugly on purpose.</strong> Out-of-the-box, Kraken is a bit ugly. That&#39;s intentional. Kraken isn&#39;t supposed to be a finished product. It&#39;s a starting point that you can adapt to any project you&#39;re working on. Add components. Remove components. Tweak the colors and font stack. Make Kraken your own.<br><br></li>
        <li><strong>Mobile-First.</strong> Kraken is built mobile-first. The base structure is a fully-fluid, single-column layout. It uses <code>@media (min-width: whatever)</code> to add a grid-based layout to bigger screens. Think of it as progressive enhancement for the layout.<br><br></li>
        <li><strong>Object-Oriented CSS.</strong> Kraken takes an <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/stubbornella/object-oriented-css">OOCSS approach</a> to web development. Throughout the stylesheet, you&#39;ll see base styles and modifying styles. Classes can be mixed, matched and reused throughout a project.<br><br>For example, <code>.btn</code> sets the default button styles and behavior, while <code>.btn-secondary</code> changes the color and <code>.btn-large</code> changes the size. A big button with secondary colors would look like this:<pre><code class="language-html">  &lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-secondary btn-large&quot;&gt;A Big Button&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="whats-new">What&#39;s new?</h2>
        <h3 id="version-13">Version 13</h3>
        <p>Kraken 13 adds modern CSS updates.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Switched from flexbox to CSS Grid for more predictability and control over layouts.</li>
        <li>Implemented CSS custom properties (also known as CSS variables) for all colors, typefaces, and sizes, making customization faster and easier.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="version-12">Version 12</h3>
        <p>Added a simple flexbox grid back in. The new grid is designed to be a starting point (and possibly removed altogether) rather than a complete templating system.</p>
        <h3 id="version-11">Version 11</h3>
        <p>Kraken 11 is all about simplifying.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The built-in grid system was remove entirely. Between Flexbox and CSS Grid, CSS layouts are incredibly powerful today. As a result, there&#39;s no good way to do a &quot;one-size fits most&quot; system.</li>
        <li>The <code>normalize.css</code> reset has been dropped in favor of a more modern, minimal reset that reflects how good modern browser are at rendering things consistently.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="version-10">Version 10</h3>
        <p>Kraken 10 changed the way spacing between grids works. Grids now sit tight against one another, and using padding to provide space between content instead of margins.</p>
        <p>This is a break change, and the only reason for the major version bump.</p>
        <h3 id="version-9">Version 9</h3>
        <p>Kraken 9 is about removing a lot of the cruft from older versions.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The build tool was removed to focus on Kraken&#39;s core strength: the CSS boilerplate.</li>
        <li>Sass mixins weren&#39;t really used, and have been removed.</li>
        <li><code>calc-em()</code> was replaced in the Sass files with native <code>em</code>-based sizing.</li>
        <li>SVG sprite styles were removed in favor of inline SVGs.</li>
        <li>CSS-only responsive tables had accessibility issues and were removed.</li>
        <li>The <code>.disabled</code> class for buttons was removed in favor of the <code>[disabled]</code> attribute.</li>
        <li>The <code>.screen-reader</code> class was renamed <code>.visually-hidden</code> to be consistent with industry norms.</li>
        <li>An accessibility bugfix was added for unstyled and inline lists.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="browser-support">Browser Support</h2>
        <p>Kraken works in all browsers, but it&#39;s optimized for modern browsers, and IE 11 and above.</p>
